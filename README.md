# Ip tracker

### What is this?
* A web application to locate on a map a certain IP.
* You can locate your IP and location if no IP provided in the search bar.
* The app is mobile friendly, all desktop features are available for the mobile users as well.
 
 
### What I've learned from doing this project
* How to use regexp for validation (here ip validation).
* How to work with geolocation services like [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) or [geoiplookup](https://geoiplookup.io/).
* How to work with maping services like [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
* What is IPV6 and IPV4.
* How to hide and protect API keys.


### How I did this project
* Recreated a given design for mobile & desktop.
* Implemented the necessary features for the app to work.
* Deployed it with Github pages.

### Possible future improvements
* Show more information about the searched IP address.
* Cross check with other geolocating web-services for a better location precision.
* Improve search speed by choosing the fastest geolocation service.
* Use a framework and not vanila js.
